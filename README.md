# "Analyzing Amazon Alexa Reviews: Uncovering User Sentiments through NLP Insights"

## Summary

In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset comprising nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews for various Alexa products such as Echo, Echo Dots, and Firesticks. The goal was to automatically classify these reviews into positive and negative sentiments by employing text processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This analysis provided valuable insights into customer satisfaction, helping to discern patterns and preferences among users, thereby enabling businesses to understand customer feedback more comprehensively.

## Approach

My approach involved several key steps. First, I meticulously preprocessed the textual data, removing noise, performing tokenization, and applying techniques like stemming and lemmatization. This clean data was then subjected to exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset's characteristics. Next, I utilized both traditional machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) and advanced deep learning models (LSTM networks) to classify sentiments. The models were trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned to achieve optimal accuracy and performance. Additionally, I employed visualizations such as word clouds and interactive histograms to enhance my understanding and communicate the results effectively.

## Solution

Through my analysis, I successfully developed accurate sentiment classification models. The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 94%, while the Naive Bayes model demonstrated an accuracy of around 92%. The deep learning LSTM model, with careful architecture design and hyperparameter tuning, achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.18%. These models provided a robust solution for sentiment analysis, enabling the categorization of reviews into positive and negative sentiments. The models were also capable of identifying misclassified examples, providing insights into potential areas of improvement.
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~94%
- Naive Bayes Accuracy: ~92%
- LSTM Model Accuracy: 93.18%
